# Computer Vision of Smoking Image Detection Using Deep Learning

## About Dataset

Source taken from Kaggle.com with Dataset Title `Smoker Detection [Image] classification Dataset`

The dataset contains 1120 images divided equally into two classes, where 560 images are of Smoking (smokers) and remaining 560 images belong to NotSmoking (non-smokers) class. The dataset is curated by scanning through various search engines by entering multiple keywords that include cigarette smoking, smoker, person, coughing, taking inhaler, person on the phone, drinking water etc. We tried to consider versatile images in both classes for creating a certain degree of inter-class confusion in order to better train the model. For instance, Smoking class contains images of smokers from multiple angles and various gestures. Moreover, the images in NotSmoking class consists of images of non-smokers with slightly similar gestures as that of smoking images such as people drinking water, using inhaler, holding the mobile phone, coughing etc. The dataset can be used by the prospective researchers to propose deep learning algorithms for automated detection and screening of smoker towards ensuring the green environment and performing surveillance in smart cities. All images in the dataset are preprocessed and resized to a resolution of 250Ã—250. We considered 80% of the data for training and validation purposes and 20% for the testing.

## Model
Accuracy prediction of the model score is 94.44% the model still can made some mistake to predict the image with 5.56% chance

## Business Insight

The model could be used to monitor smoking rates in different communities and identify areas where smoking is more prevalent. This information could be used to inform public health campaigns and interventions aimed at reducing smoking rates.

In addition, a deep learning model that can predict whether an image contains a person smoking or not smoking could also be used in the field of marketing and advertising. For example, the model could be used to analyze images of people in advertisements and determine whether they are smoking or not smoking. This information could be used to ensure that advertisements comply with regulations regarding the depiction of smoking in advertising.

Overall, a deep learning model that can predict whether an image contains a person smoking or not smoking has the potential to be a valuable tool in a variety of business contexts. It can help businesses and organizations enforce smoking regulations, monitor smoking rates, and ensure compliance with advertising regulations.
